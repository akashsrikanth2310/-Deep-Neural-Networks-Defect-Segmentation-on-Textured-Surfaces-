 Deep Neural Networks:  Defect Segmentation on Textured Surfaces 

 In this project, I will be developing a model to detect defects by Industrial Optical Inspection on Textured Surfaces. This problem can be modelled as an Image Segmentation task where I will have to find the pixels where the defect occurs in a given image. 
 
The dataset I will be using is described here: https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/node/3616 .There are many ways to solve this problem. I will attempt to solve this using deep learning and the approach we will follow is based on the paper on U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation.
